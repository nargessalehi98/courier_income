# courier_income

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project

The goal is to implement a system for calculating courier revenue. In this program, we want to identify and implement the relevant models and then calculate the courier salaries in 2 time scales. In the following, we will introduce these cases.
Couriers make different trips. Each of these trips will have different income according to different parameters (distance, type of customer, time of day, distance from the origin, etc.).
For a variety of reasons, the operations team may decide to record a fee for couriers as an increase in revenue. This increase in revenue is independent of the revenue related to courier travel.
For a variety of reasons, the operations team may decide to record a deduction for couriers. This reduction in revenue is independent of the revenue related to courier travel.
